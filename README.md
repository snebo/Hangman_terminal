# Hangman
Hangman is a simply a guessing game. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. 

## How its played
This ruby implementation has the computer generate a word -5 to 12 letters long- and the player tries to guess the word before he runs out of guesses
- Each word is 5-12 letters long
- The player has only 12 guesses available each round
- type save at anytime while guessing to save game progress (player_name is used to save file)
- You can reload your game at the start of each run (program start)


## To-do
- Visualy draw a hangman with each failed guess
